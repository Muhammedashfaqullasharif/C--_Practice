Build: converting the source file of any application into executables(.exe).
     
        The Sourcefile, By undergoing through the processing of three commandline tools i.e. compiler-> archiver-> Linker.
            produces the exicutable programs. theses programs/(library) are load into the memory of machine 
            after initiating the application.

compiler-> create the obectfiles(.obj) of the Sourcefile, which contain the binary, hexadecimal executable data.

archiver-> collect all object files from compiler and generate a static library(.lib).

linker->   Accumulating all object files and libraries defined from sourcefile and link these resources to 
            carry on the flow of execution. 
            
            * Store all resources as a dynamic link library (.DLL). which is present in memory and executed by operaing system.

Building_Methods: There are two ways to build the application. 
                    1.> By using IDE for graphical interface to manage and organise binary files. 
                            "Integrated development environment" include all build tools and commands.
                            IDE create projectfile on top of the sourcefiles, which organise and make ease in building the application.

            
                    2.> By using "Build System" to organise all sourcefiles and binary data in a text format using text editor.
                            these text commands operate build tool to build the 'targets'.
                            "TARGETS"-> collection of binary data in organised manner, used in build System.

                            * commonly used build system is 'MAKE'. textfiles it have are called as 'makefiles'.  ex: c-make, GNU make,etc.
                            * another such build system is 'BOOST-BUILD'. textfiles it have are called as 'jamfiles'.
